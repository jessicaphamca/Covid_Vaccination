    "### Overall Correlation analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. How much confirmed cases are being cured?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the correlation table, we can conclude that the confirmed cases has a high possibility to be cured due to the high positive correlation of 0.99.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Why does population have negative correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The population variable displays a very weak correlation because, from the analysis, we can see that the overall population in the world, still needs more vaccinations, or precautions against COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. From the correlation table, can we confirm that many people are getting vaccinated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. The number of people getting vaccinated and the total number of vaccinations reflect a strong positive correlation of 0.98. So, we can say that a lot of people are getting vaccinated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. What is the effect of mortality rate after COVID-19 stuck?\n",
    "\n",
    "The mortality rate displayed from the analysis is very high. There is a strong positive correlation of 1 for mortality rate of total deaths per 1 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Is it possible to expect death if COVID-19 is confirmed?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the correlation analysis, it is possible. This is because, confirmed cases to death correlation displays a very strong positive correlation of 0.96.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation between vaccination rate and other variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Mortality rate is high when infection rate has a high correlation of 0.85. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the correlation table, we saw a 85% correlation between mortality rate and infection rate. Therefore, to save lifes, Covid prevention is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Why does population have negative correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The -0.036 correlation between population and vaccine rate shows that there is no relation between population and vaccine rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. GDP and death per million has a correlation of 0. 31. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this number is not high. It is a surprise to see higher GDP country is not able to create a negative correlation with death per million figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. GDP and vaccine rate has a correlation of 0.47\n",
    "\n",
    "High GDP countrties on the other hand, does have the ability to provide somewhat higher vaccine rate. Therefore, the death rate may drop later. "

Also, this situation still has a long way to go before it becomes normal\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With reducing life expectancy and higher risk of COVID-19 infection making everyone susceptible to other lifelong health issues, it is best advised to take up vaccinations that are available to prevent the spread. "
